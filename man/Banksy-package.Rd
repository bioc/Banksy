\title{The Banksy package}
\description{
Banksy is a library and R package for network analysis.
}
\section{Description}{

Banksy is an R package that incorporates spatial information to cluster 
cells in a feature space (e.g. gene expression). To incorporate spatial
information, BANKSY computes the mean neighborhood expression and azimuthal
Gabor filters that capture gene expression gradients. These features are
combined with the cell's own expression to embed cells in a 
neighbor-augmented product space which can then be clustered, allowing for
accurate and spatially-aware cell typing and tissue domain segmentation.
