Description: Banksy is an R packaged that incorporates spatial information to 
    cluster cells in a feature space (e.g. gene expression). Spatial information
    is incorporated by averaging the features of the k nearest neighbours to 
    generate new 'neighbour' features for a given cell. This is concatenated to
    the cell's own features to generate a combined block matrix which is used
    for constructing a nearest neighbour network and Leiden clustering.
